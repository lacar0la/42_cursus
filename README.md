# 42_cursus
I started the 42 cursus on the april/2023 kickoff. The projects are diferent than piscine, because these are more difictult and need more time to make it, the methodology used for these projects is the same than piscine.
The firts project that I made was the libft library, there we need to recreate all the functions of libft in c, without use for loops or printf for example.
That project is outside this folder because it use is cross to the other projects.
The next project was the printf, and is a project that emulate the function printf, there I use some libft functions.
